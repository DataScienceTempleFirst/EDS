    "Climate change is usually referring to the general trend of warming temperatures globally.  Along with these increasing temperatures, unusual shifts in trends in weather activity such as hurricanes, storms, winds, etc are also usually classified under climate change.  While the climate can shift due to natural occurrences, scientists have found that human interventions have potentially caused the trend of warming.  One explanation for the warming could be increased solar solar activity, however scientists have found that solar activity has not generally increased during the period when temperature has increased.  \n",
