    "Professor Roger del Morales at University of Washington https://faculty.washington.edu/moral/ and his team set up circular, 9 meter radius, land plots near the volcano once it was safe to initiate the study in 1984. These plots are located in several distinct regions near the volcano cone to study the return of vegatation to these plots located in different positions relative to the colcanic cone (see mapping below). We will use this data to assess the rate of plant succession. Measures included in the data include yearly species richness, *RICHNESS*, defined as the number of species in a given region or in this case the 9 meter radius (250 m^2) land plot. We will use our data science tools to decide if the changes over time in *RICHNESS* are a pattern (Alternate hypothesis) or if they are just due to random fluctutaions (NULL hypothesis). Other variables include *COVER_%* which can also be analyzed. \n",

    "1. Create initial data tables and plots to explore the nature of the different plots included in \"data/MSH_PLOT_DESCRIPTORS2.csv\". Variables to consider include  elevation, slope, aspect (direction), impact type. You could use group or pivot methods here.\n",
    "2. Identify two *PLOT_CODE*s to study based on mapped location and characteristics given in \"data/MSH_PLOT_DESCRIPTORS2.csv\" file. Use a markdown cell to provide reasons for your two choices of plots. Include differences and similarities.\n",
    "3. Carry out exploratory data analysis on the yearly data included in \"data/MSH_STRUCTURE_PLOT_YEAR.csv\" for each of the identified plots. \n",
    "2. Formulate a hypothesis regarding plant vegation (*COVER_%*) and variety (*RICHNESS*) following the eruption. You can refer to the above links and papers for ideas. Create a detailed markdown cell to detail this hypothesis.\n",
    "3. State the NULL hypothesis for each measure.\n",
    "4. Formulate a data science plan to simulate random changes following the first year of data.\n",
    "5. Compare the the results of 1000+ simulations to the outcome.\n",
    "6. Identify a good test statistic such as positive and negative changes or other.\n",
    "7. Statistically test whether data supports the alternate hypothesis\n",
    "    1. Compute a P-value. (Hint: you can use np.count_nonzero())\n",
